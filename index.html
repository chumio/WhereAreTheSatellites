<h1>📡 Real Photographs of Satellites in Orbit</h1>

<p>
These are rare real photographs where one satellite was captured by another satellite while both were orbiting Earth.  
Images like these are uncommon because satellites are far apart and move at extreme speeds, making such shots almost impossible.

<h2>Why this photo is special</h2>
<p>
  Most pictures of satellites are either artist renderings or photos taken from the ground.  
  This one is satellite → satellite, taken in orbit.
